Ensuring Payload Limits:

1.Load Monitoring Sensors: Install load cells or force sensors on the manipulator's end effector to continuously monitor the weight of the payload.

2.Software Limits: Program the robot’s control system to include software limits that prevent operation if the payload exceeds the specified capacity.

10 points

Here are the key functional differences between the six joints of a robot (J1 to J6) and their influence on range of motion and task capabilities:

J1 (Base Joint):
Function: Rotates the entire robot body around a vertical axis.
Influence: Provides a 360-degree rotational capability, allowing the robot to orient itself for tasks in any direction.

J2 (Shoulder Joint):
Function: Allows the arm to raise and lower.
Influence: Expands vertical reach, enabling the robot to access higher or lower points within its workspace.

J3 (Elbow Joint):
Function: Bends and extends the arm.
Influence: Increases flexibility and range of motion, allowing the robot to reach around obstacles and manipulate objects in varying positions.

J4 (Wrist Joint):
Function: Rotates the forearm.
Influence: Provides rotational movement for the end effector, enhancing the ability to position tools or grippers at different angles.

J5 (Wrist Pitch Joint):
Function: Allows up-and-down movement of the wrist.
Influence: Adds further dexterity for positioning the end effector in tight spaces or specific orientations required for various tasks.

J6 (Wrist Roll Joint):
Function: Rotates the end effector around its own axis.
Influence: Offers additional control over the orientation of tools or grippers, making it suitable for precise operations, such as assembly or delicate handling.

So in short we can say that each joint contributes to the overall kinematic chain, defining the robot's workspace and ability to reach different points in three-dimensional space and
The combination of joint functionalities allows the robot to perform a wide variety of tasks, from simple pick-and-place operations to complex assembly and machining processes, depending on the degrees of freedom provided by the joints.
