# GEMINI.md: Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the "World Bank Population & Education Data Comparison" project.

## Directory Overview

This project is a simple data-processing and visualization application. It consists of two main parts:

1.  A **Python** script that fetches and processes open data from the World Bank.
2.  A **React** frontend that visualizes the processed data.

The goal is to compare population and education indicators between Bangladesh and Lithuania, at both a national and district level.

## Building and Running

The project is structured in two parts: a Python data processor and a React frontend.

### 1. Generate the Data

The Python script needs to be run once to generate the `processed.json` file that the frontend consumes.

1.  **Navigate to the `python` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd python
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will create the `processed.json` file in the `react-app/public` directory.

### 2. Run the Frontend Application

1.  **Navigate to the `react-app` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## Features

*   **Data Fetching:** Python script fetches population and education data from the World Bank API.
*   **Data Processing:** The script processes the raw data and also includes mock district-level data for comparison purposes.
*   **National Data Visualization:** The React frontend displays charts comparing the population and primary school enrollment trends for Bangladesh and Lithuania.
*   **District-Level Comparison:** Users can select a district from both Bangladesh and Lithuania using separate dropdown menus.
*   **Dynamic Comparison:** A table and a bar chart dynamically update to show a side-by-side comparison of the selected districts' population and education rates.

## Tech Stack

*   **Python:**
    *   `requests` for making HTTP requests to the World Bank API.
*   **React:**
    *   `Vite` as the build tool.
    *   `React` for building the user interface.
    *   `Recharts` for creating interactive charts.
    *   `Tailwind CSS` for styling.
