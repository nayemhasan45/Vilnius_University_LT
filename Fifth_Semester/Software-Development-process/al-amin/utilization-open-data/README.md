# World Bank Population & Education Data Comparison (Bangladesh vs Lithuania)

## Project Overview

This project is a simple data-processing and visualization application designed to compare population and education indicators between Bangladesh and Lithuania. It consists of a Python script for data fetching and processing, and a React frontend for visualization. The application allows users to view national-level trends and conduct detailed comparisons of specific districts within both countries.

## Features

*   **Data Fetching:** A Python script fetches population and education data from the World Bank API.
*   **Data Processing:** The script processes raw data, cleans it, and structures it. It also incorporates mock district-level data to enable granular comparisons.
*   **National Data Visualization:** The React frontend displays interactive charts (using Recharts) that compare population and primary school enrollment trends for Bangladesh and Lithuania over time.
*   **District-Level Comparison:** Users can select districts from separate dropdown menus for both Bangladesh and Lithuania.
*   **Dynamic Comparison View:** A dedicated section dynamically updates to show a side-by-side comparison of the selected districts' population and education rates, presented in both a table and a bar chart for easy analysis.

## Tech Stack

### Python Data Processor

*   **`requests`**: Used for making HTTP requests to retrieve data from the World Bank API.

### React Frontend

*   **`Vite`**: The build tool for a fast and efficient development experience.
*   **`React`**: The JavaScript library for building the user interface.
*   **`Recharts`**: A composable charting library built with React and D3, used for rendering interactive data visualizations.
*   **`Tailwind CSS`**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling the application with custom designs.

## Setup and Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Generate the Data

First, you need to run the Python script to fetch and process the data. This will create the `processed.json` file that the React application uses.

1.  **Navigate to the `python` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd python
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  **Execute the main script to generate `processed.json`:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This command will save `processed.json` directly into the `react-app/public` directory.

### 2. Run the Frontend Application

After generating the data, you can start the React development server.

1.  **Navigate to the `react-app` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-app
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use). Open this URL in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage

*   Upon opening the application, you will see national-level population and primary school enrollment charts for Bangladesh and Lithuania.
*   To compare districts, use the two dropdown menus provided ("Bangladesh Districts" and "Lithuania Districts"). Select a district from each to see their population and education rates compared in both a table and a bar chart.
*   The mock district data includes:
    *   **Bangladesh:** Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi
    *   **Lithuania:** Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda
